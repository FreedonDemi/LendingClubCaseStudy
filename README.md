# Lending Club Case Study
> 
This company is the largest online loan marketplace, offering personal, business, and medical financing. Borrowers access lower-interest loans via a fast online platform.

Like most lenders, credit loss from 'risky' applicants, particularly those labeled as 'charged-off' (defaulters), is a major challenge. Identifying such applicants can help reduce losses.

This case study aims to use EDA to identify the key factors driving loan defaults, enabling the company to enhance its risk assessment and portfolio management. Researching risk analytics and variable significance is recommended to build domain understanding.

The funded amount by investor for most of the loan applicants is between 5, 000 - 14, 000 USD

- Ordered Categorical Variables
Grade B had the highest number of "Charged off" loan applicants, with a total of 1,352 applicants, indicating that applicants with this credit grade faced challenges in repaying their loans.

Short-term loans with a duration of 36 months were the most popular among "Charged off" applicants, with 3,006 applications. This suggests that a significant portion of applicants who experienced loan default chose shorter repayment terms.

Applicants who had been employed for more than 10 years accounted for the highest number of "Charged off" loans, totaling 1,474. This indicates that long-term employment history did not necessarily guarantee successful loan repayment.

The year 2011 recorded the highest number of "Charged off" loan applications, totalling 3,152, signaling a positive trend in the number of applicants facing loan defaults over the years. This could be indicative of economic or financial challenges during that year.

"Charged off" loans were predominantly taken during the 4th quarter, with 2,284 applications, primarily in December. This peak in loan applications during the holiday season might suggest that financial pressures during the holidays contributed to loan defaults.
